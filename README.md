# Anotace od Chat GPT, já třeba nechápu proč vůbec jsou


Annotations in C#, like the ones you've used in your code (such as [Required], [Obsolete], and [Conditional]), serve various purposes in programming. Let's break down each of them:

[Required] Attribute:
This attribute is often used in the context of data validation, particularly when working with frameworks like ASP.NET Core or Entity Framework. When you mark a property with [Required], it indicates to the framework that the property must have a non-null value. However, in your current implementation, this attribute doesn't enforce the requirement for non-null values; it's more about documenting the intent. To enforce this requirement, you typically need additional validation logic, either in your application code or through frameworks that support it.

[Obsolete] Attribute:
The [Obsolete] attribute marks a program entity, such as a method or property, as outdated or no longer recommended for use. When you mark a method with [Obsolete], it serves as a warning to other developers that this method is considered outdated and might be removed in future versions. This is particularly useful in libraries or APIs where backward compatibility needs to be maintained. When someone tries to use an obsolete method, the compiler generates a warning to inform them about its status.

[Conditional] Attribute:
This attribute is used for conditional method calls. When you mark a method with [Conditional], it means that the method call will only be included in the compiled code if a specific compilation symbol is defined. This is often used for conditional compilation, where different builds of your application may include different parts of the code based on certain conditions. However, it's worth noting that the [Conditional] attribute is typically used sparingly and is less common compared to other attributes.

Regarding your question about why you would use these attributes:

[Required]: While it doesn't enforce non-null values by itself, it serves as documentation and can be used by frameworks to perform automatic validation.

[Obsolete]: It's crucial for maintaining code quality and informing other developers about deprecated methods or properties.

[Conditional]: This is more niche and is typically used in advanced scenarios where you want to include or exclude certain code based on compilation conditions.

In summary, annotations in C# provide metadata about your code, which can be used by the compiler, frameworks, or other tools to perform various tasks such as validation, documentation, or conditional compilation. Each attribute serves its own purpose in improving code quality, maintainability, and flexibility.
